# Requirements
## PostgreSQL
The initial dataset generation script [packages.py](src/packages.py) interfaces with a PostgreSQL database with a data dump from [ecosyste.ms](https://packages.ecosyste.ms/open-data).
Before running the [packages.py](src/packages.py) script, a valid PostgreSQL server should be running with the _packages_production_ database available.
Please be aware that **this database is about 200G when rebuilt**.
By default, the [packages.py](src/packages.py) script is configured to interface with a PostgreSQL server running on the localhost, to change this configuration, you will have to modify the `db_credentials` variable in the code.
The script also checks the `PSQL_Password` environmental variable for a password.
That can be set in linux using the following command:
```bash
export PSQL_Password=<my_psql_password>
```

## BigQuery
[packages.py](src/packages.py) also uses access to Google's BigQuery to fetch data for PyPI.
For this to work, a valid service account key must be added to the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
This can be accomplished in linux using the following command:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<creds_file>
```
Check documentation at https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc for more information.

## HuggingFace
[packages.py](src/packages.py) requires an access token to interface with the HuggingFace API.
Pass a file containing this token to the script in command line.

## Python
The scripts for this project are written in Python.
The [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) can be used to create a Python virtual environment with all necessary dependencies in _bash_ using: 
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Get Packages From Each Registry
Before checking for signature adoption in each registry, we need to get a list of all packages for each registry. 
For PyPI, NPM, Docker Hub, and Maven Central, we can run the [packages.py](src/packages.py) script to generate a list of packages and versions from each registry.
